        <h3>PB&J</h3>
            <p>Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are so good, they might be better than bean and cheese burritos. I love to make these for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desert or anytime throughout the day. Peanut butter with strawberry jelly is the best combination of flavors known to man.</p>
            <p>I'm not particular when it comes to type or brand of bread and peanut butter. But when it comes to selecting a jelly... I <strong>ONLY</strong> eat Smucker's Strawberry Jelly. This is very important to making the dish properly. You dont want to have any other flavor as they dont hit the same.</p>
            <p>You also don't want to get jam by mistake. I did that last time I went to the store, and I highly regretted it for a month. The difference is that Jelly is smooth while jam has pieces of the fruit in it. <em>Yuck</em>. The added fruit really takes away from the sandwich. I wouldn't want anyone to suffer like I did that time. I guess maybe the only time jam would be ok is if you are making the sandwich with crunchy peanut butter. This is because you might be able to mask the odd texture of the fruit in the jam with the chunks of peanuts in the chunky peanut butter. But I haven't personally tried it. So to keep it safe I would only get jelly, and strawberry flavor too, don't forget it.</p>
